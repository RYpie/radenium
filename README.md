# Radenium

Working on something incredible huge here. Unfortunately I cannot tell you what, but it is opensource, or so.
Radenium is made to work on a mac, linux follows soon after.


# For now

Check it out, run:

$ python3 radenium.py

And push a key on the keyboard, e.g. 'g' that should start a livestream of your camera.
It doesn't? That's weird, it works on my mac osx...
I think quite some dependencies, not sure which one. Will all follow...

's' should stop the livestream.

Currently working on the architecture of the application.

Roadmap:
- Use a real ffmpeg wrapper.
- Things that are top secret for now, really.
